# Project Context

## Project Overview
### Purpose
To create a VSCode extension that leverages Claude Sonnet to automate interactions with the Roo Cline extension, enabling automated chat interactions through the Cline chat UI. This extension will act as an AI-powered assistant that can engage with Cline on behalf of the user.

### Scope
- VSCode extension development
- Integration with Claude Sonnet API
- Integration with Roo Cline extension
- Automated chat interaction capabilities
- User configuration and control mechanisms

### Target Audience
- Developers using VSCode with the Roo Cline extension
- Teams looking to automate certain interactions with Cline
- Developers wanting to leverage Claude Sonnet's capabilities within their development workflow

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
While the Roo Cline extension provides powerful AI assistance capabilities, users currently need to manually interact with the chat interface for every request. This can be time-consuming for repetitive tasks or scenarios where automated interactions would be beneficial. There's a need for automated interaction capabilities that can leverage Claude Sonnet's advanced AI to engage with Cline programmatically.

### Success Criteria
- Successful integration with both Claude Sonnet API and Cline extension
- Ability to send automated messages to Cline chat UI
- Proper handling of Claude Sonnet responses
- Seamless user experience within VSCode
- Configurable automation rules and triggers

### Constraints
- Must work within VSCode extension API limitations
- Needs to respect rate limits for both Claude Sonnet and Cline
- Must maintain security and privacy of user data
- Should not interfere with normal Cline extension operations

## Strategic Alignment
### Business Goals
- Enhance developer productivity through automation
- Expand the capabilities of the Cline extension ecosystem
- Demonstrate innovative use of Claude Sonnet's capabilities
- Create a foundation for future AI-powered automation tools

### Success Metrics
- Number of successful automated interactions
- User adoption rate
- Performance metrics (response time, success rate)
- User feedback and satisfaction
- Number of automated workflows created by users

## Stakeholders
### Key Stakeholders
- Development team
- VSCode extension users
- Roo team (Cline extension maintainers)
- Claude Sonnet team
- VSCode extension marketplace administrators

### Communication Plan
- Regular updates through GitHub repository
- Documentation updates in extension README
- Release notes for each version
- Issue tracking for bug reports and feature requests
- Direct communication with Roo team for integration requirements
